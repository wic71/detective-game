1. Create a New GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.com and log in.

Click the New (or “+”) button to create a new repository.

Give it a name (e.g., detective-game) and choose Public or Private.

You can add a README if you want.

Click Create repository.

Now you have a new, empty GitHub repo ready to work with.

2. Open the Repo in Codespaces
Go to your new repo page on GitHub.

Click the Code button (the green one).

In the dropdown, select Codespaces.

If you have no existing Codespaces, click Create codespace on main (or on your chosen branch).

GitHub will now spin up a Codespace—an online development environment—for your repository. This may take a minute or two the first time.

3. Initialize Your Codespace Environment
Once Codespaces finishes provisioning, you’ll see a VS Code-like interface in your browser:

There’s a built-in terminal at the bottom (or you can open it via View > Terminal).

By default, you’ll be in your repo directory (e.g., /workspaces/detective-game).

4. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
While you can install Python packages globally in the Codespace container, it’s usually cleaner to have a virtual environment:

bash
Kopiera
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
(On Windows Codespaces images, you might do venv\Scripts\activate.)

You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

5. Install Django
In the activated venv, install Django:

bash
Kopiera
pip install django
6. Create a Django Project
Still in your repo directory, run:

bash
Kopiera
django-admin startproject DetectiveProject
This creates a folder named DetectiveProject with your core Django settings and files:

markdown
Kopiera
detective-game/
    DetectiveProject/
        DetectiveProject/
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        manage.py
7. Create the Detective App
Change directory into the newly created DetectiveProject folder:

bash
Kopiera
cd DetectiveProject
Start an app named detective:

bash
Kopiera
python manage.py startapp detective
Now your structure might look like:

markdown
Kopiera
detective-game/
    DetectiveProject/
        manage.py
        DetectiveProject/
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        detective/
            __init__.py
            admin.py
            apps.py
            models.py
            views.py
            tests.py
            migrations/
8. Register the “detective” App in settings.py
Open DetectiveProject/settings.py (in the DetectiveProject/DetectiveProject directory) and add 'detective' to INSTALLED_APPS:

python
Kopiera
# DetectiveProject/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    'detective',  # your new app
]
9. Migrate the Database
From the Codespaces terminal (still in /workspaces/detective-game/DetectiveProject):

bash
Kopiera
python manage.py migrate
This initializes the default Django database (SQLite by default) with the built-in tables for auth, sessions, etc.

10. Run the Development Server
Test your setup by running:

bash
Kopiera
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
(Codespaces typically requires binding on 0.0.0.0 so it can forward the port.)

Django will start on port 8000.

Codespaces should detect the forwarded port automatically. Check the little “Ports” tab (or “Ports” section in the bottom panel).

Click the Open in Browser link next to port 8000.

You’ll see the default Django welcome page saying “The install worked successfully!” if everything is correct.

11. (Optional) Commit and Push
You’ve likely not committed changes yet. Let’s do that:

Open the Source Control tab in the Codespaces sidebar (or just use Git commands in the terminal).

Stage all changed files, add a commit message, and commit.

Push to your GitHub repository (if it hasn’t auto-pushed yet).

This ensures your new Django project and app are stored in GitHub.

12. Next Steps
Add models for your detective game in detective/models.py.

Create migrations for your new models (python manage.py makemigrations detective) then python manage.py migrate.

Define views in detective/views.py and map them to URLs in DetectiveProject/urls.py or a new detective/urls.py that you include in the main urlpatterns.

Create templates for your signup page, detective dashboards, etc.

Reload the dev server and your Codespaces environment updates automatically.

Summary
Create a GitHub repo & open it in Codespaces.

Install Django in your container (optionally in a venv).

startproject DetectiveProject to scaffold a Django project.

startapp detective inside that project.

Register the detective app in settings.py.

Migrate the database.

Run the server on 0.0.0.0:8000 and open in browser.
